## Security Features

- **Balance Verification**: Checks your token balance before creating orders
- **Approval Management**: Automatically handles marketplace approval for your tokens
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Waits for blockchain confirmation before proceeding

## Error Handling

The application handles various error scenarios:

- **Insufficient Balance**: Checks your token balance before creating orders
- **Network Issues**: Automatic network switching and connection recovery
- **Contract Failures**: Tries multiple function names for marketplace compatibility
- **Transaction Failures**: Detailed error reporting and partial success handling

## Function Discovery

The marketplace contract interaction tries multiple common function signatures:
- `createSellOrder(tokenId, amount, price)`
- `sell(tokenId, amount, price)`
- `placeSellOrder(tokenId, amount, pricePerToken)`

This ensures compatibility even if the exact function name is different.

## Debug Output

The application provides detailed debug output in the debug panel showing:
- Connection status
- Contract initialization
- Transaction hashes
- Error messages
- Success confirmations

## Important Notes

ï¿½ **REAL TRANSACTIONS**: This application creates real blockchain transactions that cost gas fees and create actual sell orders on the marketplace.

ï¿½ **APPROVALS**: The first transaction will approve the marketplace to spend your tokens (one-time approval for all tokens).

ï¿½ **PRICING**: Double-check sell prices before confirming - orders will be listed at the exact prices you specify.

ï¿½ **QUANTITIES**: Ensure you have sufficient token balances for the quantities you're trying to sell.

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Connecting
- Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that you're on a supported browser

### Wrong Network
- The app will automatically prompt to switch to Sonic
- Manually add Sonic network if the automatic addition fails

### Transaction Failures
- Check you have sufficient balance
- Ensure you have enough native tokens (S) for gas fees
- Verify marketplace approval was successful

### Contract Function Not Found
- The app tries multiple function names automatically
- If all fail, the marketplace contract may have a different interface

## Development

### Default Port: 3080

This project uses **port 3080** by default. Always access the application at `http://localhost:3080`.

To run a local server:
```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Or manually:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 3080
```

Then navigate to: `http://localhost:3080/estfor-items-working.html`

The HTML files can also be opened directly in a browser, but using the HTTP server is recommended for proper CORS handling.
